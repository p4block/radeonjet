# radeonjet-cli
A simple AMDGPU overclocking tool for the command line

Currently in development, if you have stumbled upon this, check it out later!

Aim is to get backend functionality for a graphical overclocking frontend for AMD GPUs on Linux.

The cli tool itself will still be 100% human usable.
